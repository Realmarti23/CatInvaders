# Cat Invaders

Hey there! Welcome to the Cat Invaders Remake project! This is a super fun university project where we're giving a feline twist to the classic arcade game "Space Invaders." We're coding it in C++ and using the Qt library to make it even more purrfect!

# Game Overview

In this game, you'll control a spaceship to defend Earth from a mischievous army of invading cats. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to shoot down those cunning cats while dodging their adorable yet deadly attacks. Get ready for some furry action!

# Important Information

The folder named "project" was the original idea of the game, but due to a lot of errors and problems with moving arround the character on Mac, I decided to stop working on the code. But I decided to keep it anyway. So the folder "finishedgame" is the final and working project.
